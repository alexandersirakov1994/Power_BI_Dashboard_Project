## 👋 Introduction

I created this Power BI dashboard as a portfolio project to demonstrate my ability to turn raw labor-market data into clear, actionable insights. The data job market is full of opportunity, but the information is scattered across job boards, salary reports, and postings. My goal was to build a single, intuitive dashboard that helps users explore 2024 data-related job postings, understand salary trends, and navigate key hiring patterns.

Whether you're a job seeker, career switcher, or data professional, this dashboard provides a clean and interactive way to analyze the current market.
